**sq** is a fork of [squirrel](https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel), tuned according to my favour.

The original code belongs to The Masterminds. See [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt).

#### Changes

- renamed method: `ToSql` -> `ToSQL`
- renamed package: `squirrel` -> `sq`
- removed all `Runner` methods, e.g. `Exec`, `Query`, `Scan` etc
- formatted some comments
